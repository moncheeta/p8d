This is my website that is themed like an old school BBS.

## installing

You can use `setup.sh` to update your system and download any necessary dependencies. In addition, it will automatically set up SSL for you.

## setup

ssl should be already set up from the install phase, but you can rerun it using the `ssl.sh` script.

## running

Run `docker compose up -d` to start up all the services in the background. You can stop them by running `docker compose down`.
